## Chapter II
## General rules

1. All along the way, you'll be accompanied by a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: it's perfectly normal. Don't forget that the information in the repository and Google is always with you, as are the peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense and don't be afraid of mistakes.
2. Be mindful of the sources of information: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, reread it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a task condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like that, try to figure it out. If it doesn't work, put the question in the list of open questions, and you'll find the answer as you go along. Don't leave open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible to complete, remember that it's not true: you only see it this way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter different tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are suitable for the most meticulous and inquisitive students. These assignments are of higher difficulty and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system and those around you. After all, you're fooling yourself first and foremost.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you resort to someone else's help, make sure you always understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't do you any good.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch will be ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those designated in the assignments.

## Chapter III
## Result management

The result of your work is what is obtained upon completion of certain actions or activities, an outcome that shows your current level of professional development and growth. The result of your work also shows how you benefit and contribute to the development of the company.

In order to evaluate and record the status of whether the internship/trial period has been successfully completed or not and whether you are successfully immersed in the workflow, it is necessary to set a correct and measurable goal at the initial stage.

For example, the result you need to achieve by the end of the internship or the result you need to achieve by the end of the trial period within the framework of workflow. The more clarity you have about exactly what you need to do, when and how, the more relaxed and confident you feel about your work.

Results management starts from the moment that result is defined. How will you know the result has been achieved?

**Set a goal and define the result.**  
No one but you are responsible for getting your work done, including the moment you receive the task and define the format of the outcome. If you don't understand what the manager wants from you, it is your duty to ask him/her enough questions so it becomes clear and understandable.

For example:
The supervisor assigns you the task of carrying out a project. But what exactly does it mean? For you, doing a project can mean one thing, for a manager - another. Let's give a clear example of how a manager can set a task.  
Manager 1: I will promote you if you complete all tasks on time and with high quality.  
Manager 2: I'll promote you if all 5 projects you're working on are completed on time and launched into operation within the next three months.

Most likely, you will be more motivated to negotiate a promotion with your second manager when clear and defined deadlines and expected results are given to you. The same principle applies to setting goals in daily work. If you do not understand the goal, it is your duty to do everything to clarify it.

**The first goals.**  
Your first result is your probationary/internship result:

1. What exactly you need to learn, what systems to master;
2. What projects to complete;
3. Who to meet.

Initiate a conversation with the manager to specify the objectives for the probationary period (according to SMART).

Set goals with your supervisor for the **first week, first month, and first three months of work.** Setting goals and building a plan will add certainty and clarity to your daily work.

**Daily work and results.**  
If you don't work your goals and outcomes out thoughtful, you won't complete your day-to-day tasks successfully. If you don't want to be disappointed with your work and your supervisor's evaluation, then keep in mind that it is just as important to accept a task correctly as to do it well. You can't have one without the other.

One of the easiest tools to check that you definitely have what it takes to accomplish a task is the SMART goal setting technique.

**SMART goals in goal setting.**  
SMART is a way of describing objectives. It was developed by George T. Doran in the 80s, but it still hasn't lost its relevance. The method establishes the criteria for effective goal setting. The goal should be:

- **S**pecific The goal should be specific and clear: not "gather task requirements", but "meet with four key project customers and input the product requirements into the ToR (Terms of reference)".
- **M**easurable The wording should be quantitative. This will help evaluate the outcome and provide a benchmark. Example: not "meet with everyone," but "meet with the three key people on the project."
- **A**chievable Check that you have the resource to accomplish the task. It's your responsibility to alert your supervisor if you know you won't get it done in time. Or, in case of too much workload, raise the question of how to test tasks.
- **R**elevant Check the relevance and coherence of tasks and their alignment with the company's global objectives. You can ask questions about why it's important to do this task and what bigger task your task is a part of. Often employees worry that they don't see the whole picture. If it's important to you to see the big picture of the company's mission and purpose, think about what you can do to learn about it.
- **T**ime bound Work goes faster if a time frame is set: you can spread the load and prioritize. Not "quickly or urgently," but "by October 10" or "by 12 noon tomorrow.".

You can read more on how to set SMART goals [here](https://www.cfin.ru/management/people/dev_val/soft-skills.shtml). The article is written for the managers, but we recommend it for all employees. After reading this, you'll be much more attentive to how the task is set up and will be able to immediately see areas that need clarification.

## Communication with the manager

People say: "Man comes to the company, but leaves the boss".  
In order not to part with either the company or the manager, and for your work to satisfy both you and the manager, let's figure out what you influence in building relationships with the manager. Where's your part of the responsibility?

So, a manager is the person on whom you depend: whether you will grow, whether you will have access to the most interesting tasks, whether you will be able to work flexibly and independently. Or, for example, whether the manager will control you, how interested he/she is in your development (if interested at all). All of these factors depend not only on the supervisor, but also on you.

To begin with, let's figure out what proper relationships between a manager and an employee are. Relationships are a complex and intricate concept. Proper relationships allow people to trust, support and understand each other. There is no fear of talking about difficulties and problems, and you are able to speak boldly about achievements. It means that there is proper communication between people. There is a simple recipe to build this dialog and make the relationships comfortable for both parties.

Your and your manager's calendar should include time for you to talk about your performance and ask any questions you may have.

So, most importantly, you and your supervisor should have a regular one-on-one meeting time, like once a week, for at least 15 minutes. Why?

- You share what you've managed to accomplish during the week. Even if minimal progress is made, it's important to share results regularly.
- You'll get task adjustments and check in with your supervisor's opinions.
- You'll receive feedback on all issues.
- You can talk about motivation and discuss the difficulties that arise.
- It's also a time to talk and give notice that you're going on vacation or want a promotion.

Your goal for the first 1-3 months is to set a regular (once a week) one-on-one meeting with your supervisor. Even if the supervisor doesn't think it's necessary, insist on it: you need it to adapt.

## If something doesn't work out

_There are times when it's hard to reach an agreement or you and your supervisor disagree on something. What to do?_

The first step is to talk directly with the supervisor. Next, if you don't know how to structure the conversation or don't have someone to consult with on how best to have the conversation, you can always talk to an HR. You should not discuss the difficulties of interacting with your supervisor with your coworkers.

**Feedback** 

For the newcomers, feedback is an important developmental tool. You need to not just expect it from your supervisor and coworkers, but request it yourself. What can you learn about yourself from feedback? Typically, companies focus on performance and quality of work, personal and professional growth, teamwork and achievement of results. Looking at these aspects from other people's point of view will help you organize your work more effectively.

Even when a person thinks that they objectively evaluate their actions, they still have blind spots. Because of them, we can perceive feedback as unfair and get angry. Instead, it is better to understand the reasons for such feedback and discuss it with the manager. Perhaps you simply don't notice some negative trait in yourself.

## Communication with colleagues/peers

You spend 40 hours a week, sometimes more, with your coworkers. How those hours are spent determines both productivity and enjoyment. Therefore, it is important to strive to establish these relationships as effectively as possible from the very beginning.

Various studies confirm that having close friends among colleagues, or at least good relationships in the team, is one of the key factors that determine whether we are satisfied with our jobs. A comfortable working relationship with coworkers looks like this:

- It helps to work effectively as a team through mutual respect and open exchange of views;
- It contributes to the rapid adaptation of newcomers;
- It has a positive effect on mood, motivation and work productivity;
- It saves time and effort: instead of scheming and fighting for survival, you develop professionally.

### What are established relationships with colleagues?

You may feel comfortable if coworkers just smile and say hello when you meet them. For some people it is important to be on friendly terms with colleagues, to drink coffee together all week and cocktails on Fridays, to know that you can share personal problems and get advice.
Relations with colleagues, the quality and warmth of communication will depend on you - on your openness and willingness to communicate, to show empathy and support, to turn a neutral or friendly connection with strangers into a warm and friendly one.
